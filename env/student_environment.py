"""
Student Environment for Exam Stress Balancer (Reinforcement Learning)

This environment simulates a student's cognitive state during exam preparation.
It is responsible for:
- Maintaining the current state (fatigue, stress, retention, etc.)
- Applying actions (study, revise, rest, sleep, ignore)
- Updating the state based on predefined transition rules
- Computing rewards for reinforcement learning agents

NOTE:
This file only defines the environment structure.
No reinforcement learning logic is implemented here.
